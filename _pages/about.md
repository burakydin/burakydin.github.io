I am a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University in Operations Research and Financial Engineering ([ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu)) department, advised by Prof. [Ronnie Sircar](https://sircar.princeton.edu). I did my undergrad in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Boğaziçi University with a minor in Economics.

I have been working on mean-field approximations to tractibly analyze competition in markets of perishable goods such as airline ticket pricing (see below for the recent paper). I am also interested in investigating the consumer side of the markets and trying to model customer population.
