  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Fare Game: A Mean Field Model of Stochastic Intensity Control in Dynamic Ticket Pricing}, 
  author={B. Aydin* and E. Parmaksiz† and R. Sircar*},
  abstract={We study the dynamic pricing of discrete goods over a finite selling horizon. One way to capture both the elastic and stochastic reaction of purchases to price is through a model where sellers control the intensity of a counting process, representing the number of sales thus far. The intensity describes the probabilistic likelihood of a sale, and is a decreasing function of the price a seller sets. A classical model for ticket pricing, which assumes a single seller and infinite time horizon, is by Gallego and van Ryzin (1994) and it has been widely utilized by airlines, for instance. Extending to more realistic settings where there are multiple sellers, with finite inventories, in competition over a finite time horizon is more complicated both mathematically and computationally. We introduce a dynamic mean field game of this type, and some numerical and existence results. In particular, we analyze the associated coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov differential-difference equations, and we prove the existence and uniqueness results under certain conditions. Then, we demonstrate a numerical algorithm to find this solution and provide some insights into the macroeconomic market parameters. Finally, we present a preliminary comparison of our findings with airfare data.},
